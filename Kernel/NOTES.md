### **Program Retainer**  
An interrupt retainer for secure action handling. Programs in user-space can create a secure popup which interrupts any other programs to create safe space for important or sensitive operations, such as scaning QR codes, input username and password. Only main program (and kernel services) could run when the retainer is working. Just like UAC dialog in Windows 7+.  
### **Share Center**  
A unified channel for any program to share items, include texts, images, files and others. Applications could register as receiver to be one of the channel to share items. For instance, a mobile connector app can register as file receivers which allows users to transfer file into connected phones when some application is trying to share a file with **Share Center**.  
*This is not* ***Open With*** *application!*  
### **About App Install**
Application certification is an important reference in app installing. Only apps with valid certification could be allowed to install. There are two types of certification, **DEVELOP** and **PUBLISH**. Something important is that application with **DevCert** could only be installed when the local machine is logged in with a developer account, but anyone can apply for a **DevCert**. **PubCert** is more like a official signature, and application could be easily installed (include sideload) once it got a publish certification. Applying for **PubCert** is harder than **DevCert**. First of all, the application needs to follow all the software terms. For instance, malware, virus software is not allowed for applying the publish certification. This policy is intended to remove potential risks for users' computer.  
Application store is the only way of publishing enormous applications, but it does not mean that you are not allowed to publish your app on your own. Primarily, your applications are not forcibly required to upload to official application store, but at the same time, you are not allowed to upload to any third-party application store. In another word, third-party application store is totally banned from this operating system and we will never certificate related applcations. Generally, you can publish your application **on your own** or **by uploading it to official application store**
