# **Delegasy Kernel**  
Delegasy kernel is designed as a modern style system kernel. It's a monolithic kernel which contains process scheduling, memory management, graphics output, file system, network, device management and PnP services. One day in the future, we might migrate some parts of kernel components into user space for stability reasons, and it may eventually becomes a hybrid kernel.
